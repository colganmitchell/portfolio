I am in the process of learnign how to do web development. I also have a love a for cybersecurity and Information Security. I was always passionaate about computers, started out with a Dell Latitude 3090 when I was in middle school. I am excited about learning new technologies and programming languages. I have a strong knowledge in HelpDesk, Network Operations, Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Mobile Software and Hardware, Computer Software/Hardware, - I was also a mobile repair technician about 2 years ago but had to seek new oppurtunities due to the company closing. I love every aspect of technology even if it is something im unfamiliar with, As I mentioned I am working to expand my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS - I hope my progress can be seen and reflected in this Git.. 

This will be a place where I can store and show off my progress.. As of now I am working on my portfolio. 

Thank you for reading this!
